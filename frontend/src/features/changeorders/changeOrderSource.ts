/**
 * The site record a change order was raised from, read off its metadata.
 *
 * An RFI answered with a cost impact and an NCR closed with one each raise a
 * change order: by hand through the record's own "create variation" action,
 * or automatically as a draft when the event arrives (backend
 * `app/modules/changeorders/events.py`). Both write the same keys - `source`,
 * `rfi_id` / `ncr_id` and the record's number - and the automatic one also
 * stamps `auto_drafted: true`. This is the one place that turns those keys
 * into a label and a destination, so the banner and the "Related" pill on the
 * detail view cannot disagree about where the change came from.
 *
 * `null` when the change order names no such source, so callers draw nothing
 * rather than a pill to a bare register.
 *
 * An NCR states its cost as free text. When that text holds digits but not one
 * clear amount (`12.500` in a three-decimal currency, `approx. 5000`), the
 * order is raised at 0 with `amount_needs_review` set and the text kept in
 * `ncr_cost_impact_raw`; `amountUnread` hands that text to the view so a person
 * sees what was written and enters the amount.
