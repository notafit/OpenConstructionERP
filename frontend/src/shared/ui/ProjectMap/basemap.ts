/**
 * Shared basemap configuration.
 *
 * Every map in the app - the Cesium globe, the MapLibre 2D maps, and the
 * static card thumbnails - reaches its basemap through our own backend at
 * ``/api/v1/geo-hub/``, never through a public tile host. Browser ad and
 * privacy blockers routinely block tile hosts by name, which leaves maps
 * showing a blank square. A same-origin ``/api`` request is never blocked.
 *
 * WHY THE UPSTREAM CHANGED. The tiles used to come from CARTO's keyless
 * "Voyager" raster. It stopped being keyless without a release, a notice or
 * a single failing check: it still answers 200 with a valid PNG of the
 * correct geography, now with "API KEY REQUIRED" printed across it. The
 * refusal was in the pixels, so every status, byte-length and decode check
 * stayed green and the founder found it by looking at the screen.
 *
 * The replacement is OpenFreeMap: keyless, quota-free, ODbL, and - the part
 * that actually matters - self-hostable, so an operator who outgrows the
 * public endpoint points the backend at their own copy. Raw OpenStreetMap
 * tiles remain off the table whatever they return: the OSMF Tile Usage
 * Policy forbids proxying and app use, and they enforce by User-Agent.
 *
 * THREE SHAPES. First, interactive maps read vector tiles through the
 * vendored style below and draw the streets themselves, in the browser, on
 * the GPU. That covers every map a user pans and zooms.
 *
 * Second, the card thumbnail. It cannot consume vector data - it is a plain
 * ``<img>`` - but it no longer has to: ``./streetThumbnail`` renders this
 * same vector style once into an offscreen MapLibre instance, reads the
 * canvas as a data URL and destroys the context, so the card shows real
 * street cartography from a still image with nothing left streaming. The
 * card therefore normally shows streets and building footprints, shows a
 * neutral placeholder while the snapshot is queued, and falls back to the
 * relief tile below only when the snapshot cannot be produced (no
 * WebGL, a blocked style, a render that times out). Which of the two it is
 * showing decides which credit it must carry, and both are exported from
 * this file.
 *
 * Third, one surface still cannot consume vector data at all: the Cesium
 * globe's imagery provider, which wants raster XYZ. It reads shaded relief -
 * Natural Earth, public domain, proxied straight through - and so shows
 * terrain rather than streets. That is a deliberate downgrade in detail,
 * taken because every keyless raster street basemap has stopped being
 * keyless, and a coarse honest tile beats a detailed one with "API KEY
 * REQUIRED" printed across it. It is also what the card falls back to, so
 * the relief source stays load-bearing rather than legacy. An operator with
 * a raster street server of their own opts the globe into streets with
 * ``OE_GLOBE_STREET_TILES_URL`` and its attribution; the globe asks the
 * backend through ``fetchGlobeImagery`` below and keeps relief otherwise.
 *
 * This paragraph used to state, as settled fact, that the card could not
 * show streets and that this was a permanent property of an ``<img>``. It
 * was read that way and believed. The claim was about the tile SOURCE, not
 * about the tag: an image tag shows whatever bytes it is given, and the
 * bytes can be rendered on this side.
