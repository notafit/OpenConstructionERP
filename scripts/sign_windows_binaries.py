"""Authenticode-sign every Windows executable and library under some folders.

Why signing the installer is not enough. Windows 11 Smart App Control checks
every executable file as the loader maps it, not only the file that was
downloaded, and it has no per-app exception. The desktop sidecar is a
PyInstaller onefile build: at each start it unpacks about 490 ``.exe``,
``.dll`` and ``.pyd`` files and runs them from the unpacked folder. Measured on
the 17.x sidecar, 409 of those 492 carried no signature at all (every
PostgreSQL program, and most of scipy, sklearn, pandas, pyarrow, numpy), and the
launcher, the sidecar and the uninstaller carried none either. A signature on
the installer reaches none of them.

So the release pipeline signs from the inside out: the Python packages the
sidecar collects, before PyInstaller packs them (the archive seals them and no
later pass can reach them); then the onefile executable PyInstaller writes; then
the converters shipped as resources; and finally Tauri signs the launcher,
the sidecar copy, the NSIS plugins, the uninstaller and the installer through
``bundle.windows.signCommand``.

The signer is a command given in ``WINDOWS_SIGN_COMMAND`` as a JSON array of
arguments, the same ``cmd`` plus ``args`` shape Tauri's ``signCommand`` takes,
where ``%1`` stands for the file. JSON rather than a shell string because the
command carries Windows paths, and POSIX splitting eats their backslashes. That keeps
this script independent of which service holds the key (Azure Artifact
Signing through signtool, or a Key Vault certificate through AzureSignTool).

Files that already carry a valid signature (the Python Software Foundation's
own DLLs, Microsoft's runtime, Intel's MKL) are left alone: re-signing another
publisher's file would replace their name with ours.

Exit codes: 0 when every candidate ends up with a valid signature, 1 when any
does not, 2 on a usage error. ``--list`` signs nothing and only prints what
would be signed, so the selection can be checked without a certificate.
