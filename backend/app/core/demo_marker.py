"""Which projects are demo projects, and which demos the user removed.

Every seeder that writes demo records asks one of the two questions here and
nothing else. A demo project is one whose ``metadata_`` carries a ``demo_id``,
the tag every installer writes (the showcase and partner-pack installers and
the flagship seeder alike). It is never recognised by name, by owner or by
position in the table: a user can rename a project, the demo account can own
real work, and "the first projects" is whatever the database returns first.

A demo project the user deleted is archived rather than removed, and it is not
a demo project for seeding purposes any more. Filling it would be invisible,
since nobody opens an archived project, but it is still writing into a record
the user asked to be rid of.

The retired-demo record (:class:`DemoProjectTombstone`) is what keeps a removed
demo from being installed again. Boot installers consult it; an explicit
install by a person clears it.
