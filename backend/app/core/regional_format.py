"""How a country writes a number and a date on a generated document.

The question this answers
-------------------------
A PDF is printed for the market the project is in, not for whoever pressed the
button, so its separators and its date order belong to the project's country.
The BOQ generator used to decide them from the currency alone, and a currency
is a weak proxy for a country: the euro is written ``1.234,56`` in Germany,
``1 234,56`` in France and ``1,234.56`` in Ireland, so every Irish bill came
out in German style. A hryvnia had no entry at all and came out American.

So the country decides first, read from :data:`app.core.i18n_data.COUNTRY_DEFAULTS`,
which carries a display pattern and a date order per country. The currency is
the fallback for a project with no country, and that fallback is exactly the
table the BOQ generator used before, so a document with no country prints
byte for byte as it did.

Decimals are not decided here. How many digits an amount carries is a property
of the currency (a yen has none), and how many a quantity carries is the
caller's choice; this module only says which characters separate them.

Two characters worth naming
---------------------------
* The space a spaced style groups with is U+00A0, a no-break space, so a
  right-aligned amount in a narrow table cell is never broken between its
  thousands. Both bundled faces and the PDF base fonts carry the glyph.
* The Swiss group separator is U+0027, the ASCII apostrophe. That is what
  CLDR 48 gives ``de-CH``, ``fr-CH`` and ``it-CH`` alike (measured on ICU
  78.3, where ``Intl.NumberFormat("de-CH")`` writes ``1'234'567.89``), so the
  PDF agrees with the amount the browser shows on screen. The typographic
  U+2019 that older CLDR releases printed is still read as a Swiss pattern.

    The project's own ``country_code`` wins, with one exception. The column
    was ``NOT NULL DEFAULT 'DE'`` until revision ``v3319`` and that migration
    deliberately left every older row alone, so a project created before it
    with no country chosen holds ``DE`` exactly as a German one does. Read at
    face value that turned every such American, British, Indian or Swiss bill
    into a German one on paper, ``123.456,78 USD``, where the currency rule
    used before printed it correctly. So a ``DE`` is believed only when the
    rest of the project does not contradict it:

    * a region naming one other country wins, so a legacy project in region
      ``US`` is written American;
    * with no such region, a currency other than the euro hands the decision
      back to the currency, which is what decided before the country did;
    * a region that names Germany, or a euro project with no telling region,
      keeps ``DE``. A German project billed in dollars and priced from a
      German region is still German.

    Only ``DE`` is doubted. No other value was ever written by default, so any
    other country is somebody's answer.

    When there is no country at all the region decides. The create form does
    not always send one: it posts ``region`` and fills the country only from a
    geocoded address or an active country pack, so a project created by choosing
    "Ireland" from the region list can reach an export with no country at
    all and be written in the currency's style, which for the euro is German.
    The region is read through the classification registry's normaliser,
    the same reading that already decides the project's standard and rule
    packs, so a document and a validation run agree on the country.

    A macro region (``DACH``, ``Nordics``, ``LatinAmerica`` ...) is not read:
    its anchor country is a convention for picking a standard, and writing a
    Danish or Argentine bill in the anchor's separators would be a guess.
    That matters for the ``DE`` rule too: ``DACH`` normalises to ``DE``, so a
    Swiss franc project in region ``DACH`` must not read as agreeing with
    Germany. It falls to the currency and is written Swiss.
