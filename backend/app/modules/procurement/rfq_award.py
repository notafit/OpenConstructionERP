"""An awarded RFQ becomes a draft purchase order.

``rfq_bidding.service.award_bid`` publishes ``rfq.awarded`` once the award has
committed, and until now nothing listened: the buyer awarded a quote and then
typed the same supplier, lines and amount into a purchase order by hand. This
subscriber drafts that order. It is a draft and nothing more. Approving it is
what commits budget, issuing it is what reaches the supplier, and both stay with
a person, who also sees the vendor gate on issue.

What the draft carries
----------------------
* **Supplier.** The directory contact the quote was entered against, and only
  when that contact resolves and is one the awarding user (or the project
  owner) can see. A bidder id that does not resolve, or a contact from another
  tenant, leaves the vendor empty for the reviewer to pick, and the draft says
  so in its notes. The raw bidder id is never copied into ``vendor_contact_id``.
* **Money.** The awarded quote's own headline in the quote's own currency,
  which is what the supplier will invoice. The award record's figure is the
  same quote restated on the RFQ basis, with any missing items added back for
  the comparison; that number ranked the quotes, it is not what the supplier
  charges, so it is kept in metadata for the audit trail and not ordered.
* **Lines.** The priced scope lines of the awarded quote, in scope order, with
  the supplier's quantity, unit and rate. When those lines fall short of the
  headline the gap is ordered as one balancing line so the order still adds up
  to what was quoted; when they exceed it (an overall discount) every line is
  reduced by the same share, so each keeps its scope item and cost line; when
  there are none, the order is one lump-sum line at the headline. A
  difference within the comparison's rounding tolerance is taken up on the
  largest line. A line priced against an optional scope item is an alternate:
  it is ordered only when the headline can be seen to include it, and
  otherwise named in the notes. Either way the item amounts sum to the order
  total exactly, and every line's amount is its quantity times its rate, the
  arithmetic approval checks: where the supplier's amount and rate disagree,
  or a line was adjusted, the amount stands and the rate is restated, with
  the quoted rate named in the notes.
* **Adjustments.** Charges the supplier stated outside the headline (freight,
  installation and the like) are listed in the notes, not ordered: whether the
  supplier invoices them or the buyer sources them elsewhere is the reviewer's
  call.

Idempotency and the award standing
----------------------------------
``metadata.rfq_award_id`` is the key. A second delivery of the same event finds
the draft and stops. The award row is locked while the check and the write run,
so two deliveries racing each other serialise on it.

The draft is written only while the award still stands: the award row exists,
names the RFQ and the quote the event names, the quote is still marked awarded
and the RFQ is in an awarded status. A delivery that arrives after the award
was taken back writes nothing. A re-award (a new award id for the same RFQ)
retires a still-draft order left by the earlier award, and refuses to draft a
second order while the earlier one is past draft, because two live orders for
one RFQ is a double commitment.

The project is always the RFQ's own, read from the database, never the event
payload's.

Failure mode: everything is logged and swallowed. The award is already
committed and must never be affected; the buyer can raise the order by hand.
