"""Tell the people whose work hangs off a container that it was published.

Publishing a container (ISO 19650 Gate B, shared -> published) is the moment a
drawing or specification becomes the version a site is built from. Somebody
who measured quantities off an earlier revision, linked a BOQ position to it,
or planned an activity around those positions needs to know that the document
under their work has moved, because their numbers may now be stale. Until now
the published event reached only the outgoing webhooks, so inside the
platform nobody was told.

What a published container carries
----------------------------------
A container is a list of revisions, and each revision may cross-link a
Documents hub row through ``DocumentRevision.document_id``. Every revision
counts, not just the current one: a measurement drawn on P01 is exactly the
record that needs a nudge when C01 is published.

Who owns a linked record
------------------------
Read off the records themselves, scoped to the container's project:

``takeoff_measurement``
    ``TakeoffMeasurement.created_by`` where the measurement's ``document_id``
    is one of the container's documents, or a takeoff document opened from
    one of them (``TakeoffDocument.source_document_id``). Both shapes are
    written in practice, so both are matched.
``<target_type>`` from ``oe_file_reference``
    A deliberate file -> record link (``boq_position``, ``rfi``, ``task`` ...)
    on one of the container's documents. The owner is whoever made the link.
``schedule_activity``
    An activity whose ``boq_position_ids`` holds a position reached by either
    route above. The owner is the schedule's ``created_by``.

BOQ positions carry no owner column of their own, so a position reaches a
person only through the link or the measurement that ties it to the
document. That is a deliberate reading, not a gap papered over.

Only current project members (the owner counts) are notified, and never the
person who published: they already know.

Idempotency
-----------
Two events reach this: ``cde.container.published`` when the container
crosses Gate B, which happens once because the state machine has no way back,
and ``cde.revision.published`` for every revision added to it afterwards.
One notification per recipient per container revision. The key is the
container id in ``entity_id`` plus ``metadata.revision_id``, and on
PostgreSQL a transaction-scoped advisory lock on that pair makes two
concurrent deliveries of the same event queue behind each other instead of
both finding nothing and both writing.

The tables of other modules are reached through :data:`Base.metadata` rather
than imported, the way :mod:`app.modules.documents.references` does it, so a
deployment without takeoff, schedule or file references simply has fewer
routes to an owner instead of failing.
