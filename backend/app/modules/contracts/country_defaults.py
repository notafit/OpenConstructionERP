"""The payment terms a contract usually starts from, per country. Data, not branches.

A contract written in Germany, the United Kingdom or the Gulf does not start
from a blank page. Each market has a usual retention figure, a usual ceiling on
it, a usual way of paying it back, a payment period and a name for the interim
certificate. This module is the one place those figures are written down, so a
new contract can start from them instead of from a single platform-wide 5
percent that was, in effect, a German habit applied everywhere.

Rules this table keeps:

* **A default pre-fills and never locks.** Every figure here is what a contract
  starts from when its author states nothing. Anything the author sends wins,
  including a value equal to the default, and every value stays editable.
* **No country, no figures.** A country that has no row resolves to ``None``,
  not to Germany and not to an average. The caller must leave the field for a
  person to fill. :func:`resolve_contract_defaults` is the only reader, and it
  never falls back to another country's row.
* **Every figure says where it came from.** ``source`` is ``statute`` when a
  law states it, ``standard_form`` when a published contract form does, and
  ``industry_practice`` when it is the usual agreed figure and nothing more.
  ``reference`` names the clause, ``note`` says it in a sentence.
* **A field with no usual figure is ``None`` and says why.** Brazil has no
  days-to-pay rule, Russia leaves the period to the contract; the note says so
  rather than a number standing in for the silence.
* **Where a regional pack already writes the release events, the pack governs.**
  Germany and the United States carry their release events, with the documents
  each event needs, in the regional pack. Their rows here say
  ``"regional_pack"`` for the split and the resolver reads the percentages from
  the pack, so the two can never disagree.

Release percentages follow the engine's own convention, which is the trap in
this table: ``release_percent_of_held`` is the percent of what is *held at that
event*, not of the original retention. "Half at completion, the rest at the
end of the defects period" is therefore ``50`` then ``100``. Writing ``50`` and
``50`` would leave a quarter of the retention with no event that ever pays it.
