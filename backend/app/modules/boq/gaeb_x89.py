"""GAEB DA XML 3.3 X89, Rechnung (invoice).

An X89 is a contractor's invoice against the bill: an ``Invoice`` with a
header (number, date, kind, settlement period), the issuer and the
recipient, the invoice shares that build the amount (basic amount, VAT,
security deposit and so on), the gross total, and optionally the bill with
the quantity billed per OZ (Fachdokumentation 3.3, chapter 8).

Export
------
:func:`build_x89_xml` writes one progress claim as an X89. The claim is a
period claim (``SettlementType`` ``periodic``): every line carries this
period's quantity and value, never the cumulative figure, so a second claim
does not bill the first claim's work again. ``InvoiceType`` is
``deduction``, the schema's English for an Abschlagsrechnung.

Money rules, each one pinned by a test:

* An item's ``IT`` is the claim line's period value as stored, rounded to
  the cent. It is not recomputed from quantity times rate: a QS may have
  overridden the value, and the invoice has to say what was claimed.
* ``Totals/Total`` and ``TotalNet`` are the sum of the ``IT`` actually
  written, so a receiver adding up the items lands on the total.
* VAT is computed once, on that net total, at the rate as it stands (a
  combined 14.975 % is not rounded to 14.98 first), and ``TotalGross`` is
  net plus VAT exactly. The bill's own tax treatment decides the rate, the
  way the X84 export reads tax from the bill's tax markups (see the router).
* Retention is a ``security deposit`` share marked as a counter claim. It is
  taken off what is payable, not off the taxable amount: VAT is owed on the
  whole performance. Only retention on the work this invoice bills is taken
  off; the caller leaves out retention on stored materials, which an X89
  does not bill.
* Retention released and billed on the claim is paid with it. It is its own
  share, not taxable and not a counter claim, and it is added to what is
  payable, so the outstanding amount before VAT is what the claim says is
  due.

Check
-----
:func:`check_x89` reads an invoice someone sent and holds it against the
bill, position by position. Nothing is written. Per OZ it reports an
unknown OZ, a unit price that differs from the bill's rate, a line whose
``BillQty x UP`` does not make its ``IT``, and a billed quantity above the
bill quantity; a ``MarkupItem`` (discount or surcharge) is held against the
bill's markup of the same percentage. Then it reconciles the totals. The
per-line differences add up to the total difference by construction, which
a test pins.
