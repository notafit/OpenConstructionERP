"""Open an uploaded price list, plain or zipped, without loading it into memory.

Regions publish their lists as a single XML or spreadsheet, or as a ZIP of
several: Lombardia ships one XML of 125 MB and a second in an older layout,
Lazio nine CSV parts in two encodings, Umbria the same list as XLSX and JSON.
Each member is read through ``zipfile``'s streaming reader, so memory does not
grow with the archive, and the archive is checked before anything is inflated.

The ZIP guard reads the sizes the archive declares and refuses an archive that
would inflate past the budget, holds too many members, or packs one member
tighter than any real price list does. The real lists compress about 32 to 1
(Toscana and Lombardia XML); the ratio limit sits well above that so a real
file is never refused for compressing well, and far below what a zip bomb
needs. The declared size can lie, so every member is also read through a
counting stream that stops at the declared size plus a margin.
