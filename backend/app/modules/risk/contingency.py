"""Risk-based contingency: the register's expected monetary value against the
contingency the finance budget actually holds.

Pure functions only (no session, no app runtime), so every figure the
contingency card shows can be unit-tested on its own.

Vocabulary, as a project manager reads it:

* **EMV** (expected monetary value) of one risk is ``probability x cost
  impact``. The register's EMV is the sum over risks that can still happen.
  That is the *risk-based contingency*: what the register says should be set
  aside.
* **Allocated contingency** is the sum of the project's finance budget lines in
  the ``contingency`` category, at their revised budget as stored (the figure
  the Budgets table shows; a line revised down to 0 holds nothing).
* **Drawdown** is an amount a person confirmed against a contingency line when
  a risk materialised. Drawn money stays inside the project budget; it moves
  from "held for the unknown" to "spent on a known event", so remaining
  contingency is allocated minus drawn.

Which risks count toward EMV, and with what weight (:func:`risk_weight`, the
one rule the register summary, the Monte Carlo draw and this module share):

* A closed risk has been retired and drops out (weight 0).
* A risk with a confirmed drawdown drops out whatever its status says (weight
  0): its cost is already in ``drawn``, and counting it again as exposure, for
  example after it was reopened, would take the same money twice.
* An occurred risk waiting for its drawdown counts at its full impact (weight
  1). It is no longer a chance but a cost that is about to be drawn, so it must
  not make the position look better than before it occurred. Once a person
  confirms the drawdown, the confirmed amount moves into ``drawn`` and the risk
  leaves EMV, so the money is counted exactly once at every step.
* Every other status, including ``mitigated`` and ``monitoring``, still
  carries residual probability and counts at that probability.

Currency. Every amount carries its own ISO code. Amounts are converted into the
project currency with the project's own FX table (``Project.fx_rates``: units
of the project currency per one unit of the foreign one). An amount in a
currency the table has no rate for is never summed in its own units. Exposure
lands in ``unconverted_emv``, a budget line keeps its own row flagged as not
converted, and the code goes into ``missing_fx_rates``, so the totals stay
honest and the gap is visible.

P50 / P80. A deterministic read of the same register, no sampling. Each active
risk either happens (cost = impact) or not, independently. For a register small
enough the exact distribution of the total is built by convolution and the
percentile read off it. Past a size cap the normal approximation (mean = EMV,
variance = sum p(1-p)I^2) is used instead, which is where the central limit
theorem makes it reasonable. The method used is reported next to the figures so
nobody mistakes them for the Monte Carlo tab's sampled percentiles.
