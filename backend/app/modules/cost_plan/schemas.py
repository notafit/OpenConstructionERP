"""Response shapes for the NRM 1 elemental cost plan.

Every money figure travels as a plain decimal string (``"1234.5"``, never
``"1.2345E+3"``), so the browser formats it and never does arithmetic on a
float. Money is carried at full precision: the plan is a regrouping of the
bill, and rounding each row before it is summed is how a cost plan ends up a
cent away from the bill it was built from. Only the two derived ratios, cost
per m2 and share of total, are rounded, to two places, because nothing is
summed from them.

Element and group names are data from the NRM 1 table, not interface strings,
so they arrive here in the language of the standard. Everything else a reader
sees (column headings, the add-on labels, warnings) is a stable key the
frontend translates.
