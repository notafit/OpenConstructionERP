# WHAT THIS TABLE IS. The week the planner schedules against, which is not the
# same question as the week a statute describes. core.calendar._WORKING_WEEK
# answers that other question. A planning week may deliberately be LONGER than
# the statutory one, which is why Brazil, China and India plan six days on top
# of a five-day statutory week. It may never be shorter, because removing a day
# the country works puts every computed date on the wrong side of the weekend.
# The gate is tests/unit/test_work_calendar_rest_days_do_not_conflict.py, and
# its module docstring is the long form of this paragraph.
#
# WHAT CONSULTS IT. get_work_calendar is the only reader that computes a date,
# and every path that reaches it asks the same question the same way: the
# project's stored region, resolved once per request by
# ScheduleService.resolve_project_region. BOQ schedule generation, the three
# compute_duration call sites in this file (create_activity, update_activity
# and the get_gantt_data fallback for a stored duration of zero) and the two
# schedule imports in the router (XER and MSP XML) all pass its answer, so one
# project is planned on one week wherever its dates are counted.
#
# It was not always so. compute_duration took a region argument from March 2026
# and no caller passed one until September, so every recompute counted Monday
# to Friday while BOQ generation counted the regional week: a Gulf project was
# drawn Sunday to Thursday and recounted Monday to Friday the first time anyone
# dragged a date. Durations persisted before that fix were not rewritten. A row
# keeps the count it was given until its dates are next saved, so a schedule
# can carry both counts side by side until then. The gate against the paths
# parting again is tests/unit/test_schedule.py, the tests named for Doha and
# Berlin.
#
# core.country_coverage reads this table as well, but as a coverage probe, and
# it deliberately answers through the resolver rather than off the table: the
# keys are a mixed vocabulary rather than country codes, so reading them
# directly gives the wrong answer. It computes no dates.
#
# WHERE EACH WEEK CAME FROM is recorded per entry. An entry with no note is
# one whose source was never recorded, and that is worth knowing as such.
