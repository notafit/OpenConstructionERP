"""Cross-module deadline aggregator - query + normalise layer.

Modeled directly on :mod:`app.modules.dashboard.inbox`. Each collector imports
its sibling model **inside** the function, and the caller wraps every collector
in ``try/except`` + ``session.rollback()`` so one disabled or broken source only
blanks its own rows - never the whole register or the sweep. This introduces no
new store: it reads the existing per-module tables and normalises them into the
transport ``DeadlineItem`` shape (see :mod:`schemas`). The pure filter/sort/count
logic lives in :mod:`logic` (DB-free, unit-tested).

Deadline sources, with their pinned terminal (closed) status vocabularies - read
from each source's schema/register layer, never guessed:

* correspondence response deadlines - ``oe_correspondence_correspondence``.
* NCR corrective actions - ``oe_qms_ncr_action`` (project via parent ``QMSNCR``).
* punch items - ``oe_punchlist_item``.
* RFI responses - ``oe_rfi_rfi``.
* submittal returns - ``oe_submittals_submittal``.
* variation decisions - ``oe_variations_request``.
* temporary-works design clearance - ``oe_temp_works_item``.
* temporary-works permit expiry - ``oe_temp_works_permit``.
* defect rectification - ``oe_dlp_defect``.
* scheduled quality inspections - ``oe_inspections_inspection``.
* compliance document expiry - ``oe_compliance_docs_doc``.
* bid submission deadlines - ``oe_bid_management_package``.
* signature session expiry - ``oe_signing_session``.
* payment-plan claims not yet raised - ``oe_contracts_milestone`` (reached, no
  live ``oe_contracts_progress_claim`` names it).
* payment-plan instalments falling due - ``oe_contracts_milestone``
  (``forecast_due_date``).
* records of modules built with the module builder that have a deadline -
  each such module's own table, the field its spec names in ``features.due``,
  closed by the states its spec marks ``done``.

Inclusion rule: a row belongs on the register when somebody is blocked waiting on
it AND its status vocabulary has a state that closes it. That rule keeps out the
much larger population of ``expires_at`` columns that are session, token, lock or
cache TTLs (portal shares, collaboration locks, resumable uploads, takeoff jobs,
field-diary links, refresh tokens): nobody is waiting on them and nothing closes
them. File approvals already own their overdue sweep via
``approval_routes/sla_monitor.py`` so they are intentionally NOT collected here.
