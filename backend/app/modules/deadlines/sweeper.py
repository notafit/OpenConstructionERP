"""Cross-module overdue sweep - background push + escalation + digest.

The thin, impure glue that turns the read-only register (:mod:`service`) into a
proactive push. Modeled on ``approval_routes/sla_monitor.py``: a single
forever-loop wakes every :data:`POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, never raises out, and is
started once from the application lifespan. No Celery, single process.

Per sweep, for every currently-overdue item across every project:

* notify the owner (or, when the owner is not a real user, the project
  managers) with an in-app ``deadline_overdue`` notification,
* fan the same event into the notification digest so users on an hourly/daily
  cadence get one rolled-up email instead of a stream,
* publish a ``deadlines.<module>.overdue`` timeline event, and
* once the item has sat past a grace window, escalate it to the project
  managers exactly once (``deadline_escalated``, metadata ``level=1``).

De-duplication is migration-free, exactly like ``sla_monitor``: before
notifying, the sweep reads the notification store for ``deadline_overdue``
rows on the same entity. One inside :data:`RENOTIFY_WINDOW_HOURS` silences
this tick; :data:`MAX_OVERDUE_NUDGES` of them silence the item for good, which
is what stops an item nobody resolves from being nudged forever.
The escalation tier reconstructs from the ``deadline_escalated`` notifications'
``metadata.level`` so a target is escalated at most once. This reuses the
*technique* of ``escalation_service`` (notification-store tier dedup), not the
service itself, which is bound to approval Instance/Route/Step and not reusable.

A few sources also want a heads-up before the date passes. Those listed in
:data:`APPROACHING_NOTIFY` get one ``deadline_approaching`` notification per
due date once the item enters their window, deduped the same migration-free
way on ``(entity, metadata.due_date)``. Payment-plan instalments are the first:
the project managers hear a week ahead that a client payment falls due. The
client is never reminded from here; that is a separate opt-in
(``terms.payment_plan.client_reminders``) this module does not send.

Each pass also heals stale payment-plan forecasts (see
``service.heal_stale_plan_forecasts``).

    The nudge and the escalation get a savepoint each. They shared one, so an
    escalation that raised rolled back the nudge's dedupe record after its
    email had already been published, and every later tick sent it again.

    Every collection runs before the first write. A collector that fails rolls
    the whole session back (see ``service._collect_all``), and a rollback after
    a nudge would erase the dedupe record of an email that already went out.
    The forecast heal therefore runs after collecting too: it changes no date
    a reminder reads, only those of instalments not reached yet. The
    approaching reminders run last and are not counted in the return value.
