"""What every country and industry pack has to be true about, checked for all of them.

The Hungarian pack was taken apart in 18.3 and eight kinds of defect came out
of it: a rule set named by the classification instead of the engine, a locale
that was never shipped, numbers read a thousand times too small, an install
that did nothing, a cost base that silently belonged to another country, and
so on. None of them was Hungarian. Each one was a property the pack framework
promises and nothing held it to, so every other pack had the same chance of
carrying it, and most did.

So this file does not list packs. It walks ``packs/*`` and asks the same
questions of each one it finds, which means a pack added tomorrow is held to
the same answers without anybody remembering to add it here. Where a pack is
excused from a question the excuse is written down with its reason, and a
test checks that no excuse outlives the defect it covered.

The questions, by the defect class that produced them:

* C1, rules: every rule set a pack or its country selects is registered, a
  project of the country runs national rules even when it was created without
  the pack, a country row never adds another standard's "code required" rule,
  and every demo bill a pack installs clears the rules it would be validated
  with.
* C2, locale: the pack's language is shipped and offered, it is the country's
  own language when the interface has one, and the demos and onboarding speak
  it too.
* C3, formats: the country has an exchange row, and the importer reads the
  numbers the market writes (decimal comma or decimal dot, the separators
  between thousands, a currency sign in front) as the number they are.
* C4, install: every entry point resolves to a pack, and a pack switched on
  through the environment variable the READMEs document reports as applied.
* C5, market: every declared cost region loads, loads a base of the pack's own
  country and currency, and a country with a published base declares one.
* C6, classification: the classification a pack names is one the platform
  labels.
* C7, hygiene: rule documents name only rules that run, no personal e-mail
  address ships, and the tax template agrees with the rate beside it.
