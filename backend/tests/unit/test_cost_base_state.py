"""A cost base's market and language survive a restart, a second worker and a return home.

Which market a national base is priced into, and which language its text is in,
used to live in a process-local dict and in the browser. These tests run against
a real PostgreSQL database (a throwaway clone per test, ``isolated_engine``) and
model a second worker or a restarted process as a second engine on the same
database, so nothing the first one kept in memory can help the second.

What they pin:

* the stored state round-trips through the table and reads the same from a
  fresh engine; partial writes leave the other fields alone;
* two users switching two different bases at once, on two workers and through
  the switch endpoint itself, each get their own state, rows and catalogue;
* the advisory lock excludes a second worker on the same base and only that
  base, with the in-process lock taken out of play so it cannot pass for it;
* ``/base-catalog`` reports what is stored, and "unknown" for a loaded base
  with nothing stored;
* the language swap is skipped after a restart only when the stored language
  matches, which is the bug the process-local dict had;
* a market switch reprices, stores the market and mirrors the market catalogue
  into the Resource Catalog without touching a resource a person added;
* a return to the home market gives every work item its home rate, components
  and currency back, ids kept, an item the home file does not hold untouched,
  and rebuilds the price sheet and the catalogue;
* a priced recipe the home file does not hold is repriced from the home sheet,
  never relabelled, and the home sheet is never seeded from market prices;
* catalogue rows keep their ids across switches, so assembly links survive,
  and the catalogue is written while the switch still holds the lock;
* a price sheet rebuild that fails rolls back to a full sheet, answers 502
  and leaves the base marked as switching until a second return home;
* an ``already_loaded`` load retries a home-language switch that did not land,
  and only when the stored state says so.
