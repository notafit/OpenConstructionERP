"""Shutdown waits, within a bound, for detached event subscribers.

``EventBus.publish_detached`` hands the request back at once and lets the
subscribers run afterwards. Before :meth:`EventBus.drain` existed nothing ever
awaited those tasks: a restart that landed while one was running disposed the
database engine under it, and whatever the subscriber was about to write was
lost with no trace beyond a "Task was destroyed but it is pending" line.

Every test here uses its own ``EventBus`` instance. The suite's conftest
replaces ``publish_detached`` on the global singleton with a synchronous shim,
so only a fresh instance exercises the production path that fills
``_background_tasks``.
