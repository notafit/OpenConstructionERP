"""The BOQ access guards answer in one statement, and refuse exactly as before.

Opening a bill in the editor fires one request per panel: the bill, its markups,
its cost breakdown, its classification, the structural limits and the project.
Every bill-scoped one stands behind ``_verify_boq_owner``, which read the bill's
project, then the project's owner, then (for anyone but the owner) the caller's
team membership: two statements per request for the owner and three for a team
member, before any work. Measured on a three-line bill, the page load cost the
owner 57 statements and a team member 62.

The guards now read the bill, the owner and the membership in one statement, and
``_verify_project_owner_for_boq`` reads the project's owner, status and the
membership in one statement instead of loading the whole project (which dragged
its milestones and WBS in through ``selectin``) and then the membership. These
cases pin that, and pin that nothing about who is refused changed:

* A differential oracle. The guards as they were are copied below verbatim, and
  over every caller (owner, team member, member of a different project,
  stranger, admin, a caller id that is not a UUID) and every target (a live
  bill, a bill on an archived project, a bill that does not exist, a live
  project, an archived project, a project that does not exist) the old and the
  new answer identically: the same status and the same detail, or both let the
  caller through.
* The same refusals over HTTP on the editor's own endpoints and on the
  comparison, which now guards both bills in one statement.
* Statement counts: the guard is one statement, the old guard run under the
  same counter shows two or three (so the counter is not blind), a team member's
  page load costs no more than the owner's, and the whole load stays under a
  ceiling.
