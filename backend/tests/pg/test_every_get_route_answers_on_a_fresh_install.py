"""Every GET route of a fresh install answers the demo admin without breaking.

A self-hosted user boots the platform with the demo seed on, signs in with the
"Try demo" tile and clicks around. Each screen reads one or more GET routes, and
a route that answers 500, or 422 to a call the frontend would make, is a dead
page. Module tests exercise routes one module at a time against fixtures they
build themselves, so a route that breaks only on the data the demo seeder
writes, or only once every module is mounted together, is invisible to them.

This test boots the application exactly as a user gets it, runs the full
lifespan (every module loaded, the showcase and flagship demo projects seeded),
signs in through ``/auth/demo-login/`` the way the login page does, and then
calls every mounted GET route:

* routes without path parameters directly;
* ``project_id`` and its spellings with a seeded demo project;
* any other id with a value taken from the matching list route, resolved left
  to right so nested routes get a parent id first, and only a value the
  parameter's declared type accepts. A parameter nothing can resolve is skipped
  and the reason is written into the report;
* a route that needs one of several query parameters with the one
  :data:`_EITHER_OR` names;
* every route that declares ``project_id``, ``limit`` or ``offset`` a second
  time with the values the frontend sends, clamped to the route's own bounds.

The routes come from :func:`app.core.module_loader.served_routes`, one URL per
endpoint. ``app.routes`` is not enough: since FastAPI 0.141 an include adds one
marker instead of copying the router's routes, and this test walked the 13
routes the application declares itself, on every run, while reporting green.
A floor (served GET paths >= GET paths in the OpenAPI document) now fails a
walk that shrinks like that again, and the counts are printed into the log.
The same table is checked for routes an earlier route answers in their place
(``tests/_route_shadowing.py``).

A failure is a 5xx, a 422 on a call whose every parameter was resolved, a body
that does not validate against the route's ``response_model``, or an answer
slower than :data:`_SLOW_SECONDS`. Every call, failed or not, lands in a report
(JSON and Markdown) written to ``OE_API_SMOKE_REPORT_DIR``, which CI uploads as
an artifact.

The boot is the expensive part (the full demo seed), so the test is gated twice:
it lives in the PG lane and additionally needs ``OE_API_SMOKE=1``. The
dedicated ``api-smoke`` job in ``ci-postgres.yml`` sets both, together with
``SEED_DEMO=true`` and ``OE_TEST_FAST_STARTUP=0``, which the suite-wide
conftest otherwise defaults the other way.
