"""PG: a deleted project is gone from every cross-project list that offers it.

Deleting a project archives it (``status = "archived"``) and keeps the row so
it can be restored. The projects list and the dashboard already leave archived
rows out; the analytics overview did not, so a deleted demo or test project
stayed in the "Project Comparison" table and the "Budget Breakdown" chart, and
clicking it answered "Project not found". The two BCF project lists, the
portal project picker and the rows behind the "active projects" KPI had the
same hole.

Each test seeds a live project and a deleted one with the same data, deletes
through ``ProjectService.delete_project`` (the path the UI uses) and asserts
the live one is still listed, so a list that went empty does not pass.

Gated by ``OE_TEST_DB=pg`` (see conftest).
